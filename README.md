## 🎯 Goal

Build a **lightweight, scalable event platform** that supports:

* Event creation and publishing
* Public discovery (SEO-friendly)
* Invitations and RSVP tracking
* Reliable transactional email delivery

The platform prioritizes **developer experience (DX)**, **performance**, and **cost efficiency** during early-stage growth.

##  🧩 Philosophy

- Core: **narrative-first pages**, **smart defaults**, **temporal behavior**, and **modular components**
- Page Flow: Story-driven **event pages** with **editorial photography** and **structured sections**
- UX: **intuitive editor**, **live previews**, and **easy sharing**
- Guidance: We are building an editorial, crafted, respectful experience — not a page builder.


## 🛠️ Core workflow:

1. Organizer creates event
2. Organizer sends invitations
3. Invitee RSVPs via secure link (magic token)
4. Reminders and confirmations via email
5. Dashboard with analytics & insights

---

## 🧭 Intended Scope

### Core Capabilities

* Public event pages (indexable, crawlable)
* Event metadata (date, time, location, description)
* Invitation + RSVP workflow
* Transactional email (invites, confirmations, updates)

### Non-Goals (for now)

* Ticketing & payments
* Complex seat management
* Native mobile apps
* Real-time chat or social features

---

## 🧱 Architectural Principles

* **SEO-first**: Multi-page, statically generated pages where possible
* **Serverless-lean**: Pay-per-use backend with minimal operational overhead
* **Composable stack**: Best-of-breed tools that integrate cleanly
* **Iterative delivery**: MVP → feedback → incremental expansion

---
